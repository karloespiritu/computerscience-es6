# Computer Science Core Fundamentals in ES6

A collection of basic fundamental data structures and algorithms essential to front end development, all written in ES6.

## Introduction

Modern front end development requires knowledge on several technologies such as -- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, design patterns, browser performance, regular expressions, security and many others. But fundamental concepts in Computer Science are often ignored, as they are not dealt with on a regular basis.

Having a solid grasp of the core concepts in Computer Science such as data structures and algorithms enables you to build more robust, complex, and reliable applications.

The following are some fundamental data structures and algorithms important to front end development.

## Data Structures

* Binary Tree
* Doubly Linked List
* Hash Table
* Max Heap
* Queue
* Singly Linked List
* Stack
* Trie

## Sorting Algorithms

* Binary Search
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
